# Chord Reader 2
ChordReader 2 is an enhanced version of ChordReader, developed by Nolan Lawson. It's intended to keep compatibility to old devices, as old tablets still serves well as book of music. ;)

It's an app that:
> fetches chord charts and tabulatures for your favorite songs from the Internet,
> saves them to a local file,
> displays them in an easy-to-read format with the chords highlighted in an autoscroll view,
> transposes the identified chords up or down, or you can add a capo,
> provides common chord variations.

# Status
This is a fork of the abandoned ChordReader app by Nolan Lawson, and Marcel Klehr respectively. It's still under development, e.g. playlists are planned to be implementend.
